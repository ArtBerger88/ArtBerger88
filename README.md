- 🌱 I'M LEARNING something new daily,software wise somewhat directed id like to think. I needed the basics, started with PYTHON back in 2023' because thats what I heard was one of the most popular and easy to learn languages, breached C with the CS50 2023 youtube video, very good information, great presentation I recommend to anyone whos learning anything computer Science. I Also learned HTML and CSS with FreeCodeCamp super easy to understand, fun to build webpages with. JAVASCRIPT took some time, but the functionality it can add is awsome. Looking to branch to other languages and projects. I've made a simple if/else PY based adventure game just because I wanted to(Feb24'), severely basic but the program runs. Just converted it into JAVASCRIPT(Nov25') to host on my webpage. Its turned out to be a sweet, fun, and awsome project that continues to grow and evolve. Doing many other mini projects at Freecodecamp.org, I have 2 Certifications from their site, more to come!!! Its a great resource. Learning should never cease.

- 💞️ I'M LOOKING TO COLAB on anything. Helping spin up another site for family as of mid 2025.

- 😄 😄I'm just a guy wanting to play with computers.

- ⚡ FUN FACT: Huge Original Trilogy Star Wars Fan!!!!! Anything SciFi or space related, I'm really am interested in.
