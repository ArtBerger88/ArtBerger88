- 👋 HI, I’m Art Berger, i can be contacted by my business email which is Artberg88@Gmail.com
- 👀 I'M INTERESTED IN quite the range of topics anything outer-space related is really cool to me, Horticulture has been my main case of study the last 2 decades, so 'naturally'(pun intended) plant genes and plant chemical composition is quite interesting to me. Computers have always played a part in my life and at the moment my focus is learning and getting a job in the computer science feild. Front-end, back-end both i want to learn intricately. Really any type of Web Development sounds fun, also building web pages has been a blast in pratice. Graphing with Data might be interesting as well, I'm absolutly a numbers guy and graphs just make sense to me, I could see myself going places in the Data space for sure.
- 🌱 I'M CURRENTLY LEARNING everything possible, but somewhat directed id like to think. Started with Python because thats what i heard was one of the most popular and easy to learn languages, breached C with the CS50 2023 youtube video, very good information, great presentation I recommend to anyone whos learning anything computer science in the C language  feild. Also I did some html and css on FreeCodeCamp super easy to understand the basics, Javascript took some time to learn, and im sure theres plenty more to unveil behind that curtain. Looking to branch to other lang and projects. Recently I made a simple if/else Py based adventure game because it sounded fun, severely basic but the program runs. Doing many other mini projects at Freecodecamp.org, like a portfolio page and many others. Its a great resource for beginners. Learning should never cease.
- 💞️ I'M LOOKING TO COLAB on front-end or anything javascript. I am also open to any potential possibilities, any colab or project is welcome ill find something viable to contribute.
