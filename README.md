 🌱
- I'M LEARNING:
-   Something new daily.
  
-   Software wise, some backstory.
  
-   I needed the basics, started with PYTHON back in 23' because of its popularaity and how easy to learn of a language it was said to be, breached C with the CS50 2023 youtube video, very good information, great presentation I recommend to anyone whos learning anything computer Science. I Also learned HTML and CSS with FreeCodeCamp super easy to understand, fun to build webpages with. JAVASCRIPT took some time, but the functionality it can add can be pretty awsome. Doing many other mini projects at Freecodecamp.org, I have 2 Certifications from their site, more to come!!! Its a great resource.
-   Looking to branch to other languages and projects, learned a bit of SQL and databases, some shell.
  
-   I've made a simple if/else PY based adventure game just because I wanted to(Feb24'), severely basic but the program runs.
-   Just converted it into JAVASCRIPT(Nov25') to host the full working game with audio and image inserts, as a subdirectory of my webpage. Its turned out to be a sweet, fun, and an awsome project that continues to grow and evolve.

-   Learning should never cease.

 💞️
- I'M LOOKING TO COLAB:
-   On anything. Helping spin up another site for family as of mid 2025.

 😄 😄
- I'm just a guy wanting to play with computers.

 ⚡
- FUN FACT:
- Huge Original Trilogy Star Wars Fan!!!!! Anything SciFi or space related, I'm really am interested in.
