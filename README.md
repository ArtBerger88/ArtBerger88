- 👋 Hi, I’m Art Berger, i can be contacted by my business email which is Artberg88@Gmail.com
- 👀 I’m interested in in front-end, back-end, and full stack Development. Web Development sounds fun, Graphing and things with Data might be interesting. Computer Learning has always seemed really interesting, and some real deep back end lang stuff really sounds fun.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything Computer. Started with basic Python because thats what everyone said was popular (Data isnt really my greatest interest), breached C with a 50+hr CS50 youtube video. Also I'm doing some html and css at the moment at FreeCodeCamp, looking to branch to other lang and projects. Most recent i made a simple if/else Py based adventure game because it sounded fun, severely basic but the program runs. Doing many other mini projects at Freecodecamp.org, like my portfolio page and so many others. Its a great resource for begginners, im learning a lot over there.
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn as much as i can find some work so i can make some money from the knowledge and skills i've built, i am open to any potential possibilities, any colab or project is welcome.
