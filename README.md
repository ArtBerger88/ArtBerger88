- 👋 Hi, I’m Art Berger
- 👀 I’m interested in in front-end, back-end, and full stack Development..
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything Computer. Started with basic Python because thats what everyone said was popular (Data isnt really my greatest interest), breached C with a 50+hr CS50 youtube video. Also I'm doing some html and css at the moment at FreeCodeCamp, looking to branch to other lang and projects. Most recent i made a simple if/else Py based adventure game because it sounded fun, severely basic but the program runs. Doing many other mini projects at Freecodecamp.org, like my portfolio page and so many otheres. Its a great resource for begginners.
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn as much as i can for some time until im ready to actually get to work and then potentially colab on something, i am open to any potential possibilities, throw something out.
