- 👋 Hi, I’m Art Berger, i can be contacted by my business email which is Artberg88@Gmail.com
- 👀 I’m interested almost anything. Front-end, back-end both sound really intriguing. Really any type of Web Development sounds fun, Graphing with Data might be interesting as well, I'm absolutly a numbers guy and graphs just make sence to me. Computer Learning has always seemed quite interesting,a lot to wrap ones head around in that topi. I would love some real deep low level lang stuff, really get in tune with whats going on at that base level.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything Computer. Started with basic Python because thats what everyone said was popular (Data isnt really my greatest interest tho Python has many uses), breached C with the CS50 2023 youtube video, very good information, great presentation I recommend to anyone whos learning. Also I did some html and css on FreeCodeCamp seemed super easy, Javascript proved to take some time to learn. Looking to branch to other lang and projects. Recently I made a simple if/else Py based adventure game because it sounded fun, severely basic but the program runs. Doing many other mini projects at Freecodecamp.org, like my portfolio page and so many others. Its a great resource for begginners. Learning a lot over there.
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn as much as i can find some work so i can make some money from the knowledge and skills i've built, i am open to any potential possibilities, any colab or project is welcome. Fast Learner!!!!
