-  I'M INTERESTED IN getting a job doing what i am pattionate about, currently Computer Science.
-
- 🌱 I'M CURRENTLY LEARNING everything possible, but somewhat directed id like to think. Started with Python because thats what i heard was one of the most popular and easy to learn languages, breached C with the CS50 2023 youtube video, very good information, great presentation I recommend to anyone whos learning anything computer science in the C language  feild. Also I did some html and css on FreeCodeCamp super easy to understand the basics, Javascript took some time to learn, and im sure theres plenty more to unveil behind that curtain. Looking to branch to other lang and projects. Recently I made a simple if/else Py based adventure game because it sounded fun, severely basic but the program runs. Doing many other mini projects at Freecodecamp.org, I have 2 Certifications from their site, more to come!!! Its a great resource for. Learning should never cease.
