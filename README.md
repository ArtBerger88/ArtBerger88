- 👋 Hi, I’m Art Berger
- 👀 I’m interested in in computer sciences.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything Computer. Started with Python and C, doing some html and css at the moment, looking to branch to other lang and projects. Most recent i made a simple if/else Py based adventure game. Also doing projects at Freecodecamp.org, like my portfolio page website HTML file.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that anyone is willing to take on a beginner. Still have a lot to learn.
- 📫 artberg88@gmail.com is my email.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Huge Original Star Wars Fan
