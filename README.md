-  Learning daily and building websites for example my business page, artoflawncare.com which is hosted right here on github pages.

- 🌱 I'M LEARNING something new daily,software wise somewhat directed id like to think. I needed the basics, started with Python because thats what i heard was one of the most popular and easy to learn languages, breached C with the CS50 2023 youtube video, very good information, great presentation I recommend to anyone whos learning anything computer science. Also I did some html and css on FreeCodeCamp super easy to understand, Javascript took some time, but what can be done with it is getting fun. Looking to branch to other languages and projects. I've made a simple if/else Py based adventure game just because i wanted to, severely basic but the program runs. Doing many other mini projects at Freecodecamp.org, I have 2 Certifications from their site, more to come!!! Its a great resource. Learning should never cease.

- 💞️ I'M LOOKING TO COLAB on anything. Helping spin up another site for family as of mid 2025.
