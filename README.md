-  I'M INTERESTED IN getting a well paid position doing what I am passionate about, currently mostly everything Software related.
-  Learning and building websites like artoflawncare.com which is hosted right here on github pages.

- 🌱 I'M LEARNING everything possible, but somewhat directed id like to think. I needed the basics, started with Python because thats what i heard was one of the most popular and easy to learn languages, breached C with the CS50 2023 youtube video, very good information, great presentation I recommend to anyone whos learning anything computer science. Also I did some html and css on FreeCodeCamp super easy to understand, Javascript took some time, but is getting fun. Looking to branch to other languages and projects. I've made a simple if/else Py based adventure game because it sounded fun, severely basic but the program runs. Doing many other mini projects at Freecodecamp.org, I have 2 Certifications from their site, more to come!!! Its a great resource. Learning should never cease.

- 💞️ I'M LOOKING TO COLAB on anything.
